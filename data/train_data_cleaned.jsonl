{"text": "Redmi has always have been the the king of budget segment.And yet another they gave us the Redmi 6 pro.It's a beautifully designed,strong and durable.And the camera is awesome just like the Note 5 pro,Display is crisp and the notch is in good shape, means it does take whole screen.Sound quality is clear and loud.But the headset experience is awesome.The Battery is 4000mah which is crazily optimized.In heavy useage it will give 2 day and a half in normal useage it give 3 days.And best thing is the inbuild Mi sercurity which loaded with features.You don't need third security apps.And the phone do charge little faster on it's stock adapter.Atleast 2hrs and 45mins.As it's a Qualcomm Chipset.", "label": "positive"}
